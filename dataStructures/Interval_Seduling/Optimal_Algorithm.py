Algorithm-1 : Earliest Finish time first (Left to right sweep).
Input: A set of activities with start times and finish times.
Output: Maximum sized set of non-conflicting activities that may be scheduled.

Algorithm-2: Latest Start time First (right to left sweep).
Input: A set of activities with start times and finish times.
Output: Maximum sized set of non-conflicting activities that may be scheduled.
